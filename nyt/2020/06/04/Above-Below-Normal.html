<p><strong>Whats the purpose of this visualization?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Comparing recent totals of deaths from all causes can provide a more complete picture of the pandemic’s impact than tracking only deaths of people with confirmed diagnoses. Epidemiologists refer to fatalities in the gap between the observed and normal numbers of deaths as “excess deaths.”</p>
<p>Indeed, in nearly every state with an unusual number of deaths in recent weeks, that number is higher than the state’s reported number of deaths from Covid-19. On our charts, we have marked the number of official coronavirus deaths with red lines, so you can see how they match up with the total number of excess deaths.</p>
<p>Measuring excess deaths is crude because it does not capture all the details of how people died. But many epidemiologists believe it is the best way to measure the impact of the virus in real time. It shows how the virus is altering normal patterns of mortality where it strikes and undermines arguments that it is merely killing vulnerable people who would have died anyway.</p>
<p>Public health researchers use such methods to measure the impact of catastrophic events when official measures of mortality are flawed.</p>
<p>Measuring excess deaths does not tell us precisely how each person died. It is likely that most of the excess deaths in this period are because of the coronavirus itself, given the dangerousness of the virus and the well-documented problems with testing. But it is also possible that deaths from other causes have risen too, as hospitals have become stressed and people have been scared to seek care for ailments that are typically survivable. Some causes of death may be declining, as people stay inside more, drive less and limit their contact with others.</p>

<p>First we chart the excess deaths. Excess deaths is calculated as the difference b/w all cause mortality data with average expected deaths for the week.
